# Will be completed #

  * 40 hrs.  Complete bioregion model
  * 12 hrs. Visualize remaining data layers
  * 4 hrs. setup smtp email for forgotten password
  * 4 hrs. setup account registration
  * 1 hr. Pre-create accounts for attendees as well as a common group for them to share in. Need list.
  * 3 hrs. Way to learn more about the weights, like a 'what's this?'
  * 1 hr. title 'Bioregion result for xxx' to just 'xxx'?
  * 1 hr. provide sense of size small: (city), large (country).  Put in the option or maybe a what's this? link
  * 2hrs. Better explanation/framing of parameters.  call to action.  For example headers saying 'what point do you want your bioregion to center around?' or 'what 'factors' are most improtant to you'
  * 2hrs. What's it doing while creating your bioregion?  short text
  * 2 hrs. click to create bioregion shouldn't show every time you load the tool, only until you create your first one.  Also had issue where reloading with data and tools panel open would load this message on the data tab.
  * 1hr-6hrs - ask for feedback on the bioregion, is there something funny about it?  This could be asked after running the analysis and it's loaded on the map.  Simple attribute is easiest in edit panel but more work to ask the question by itself in a panel (agree or disagree)
  * 2 hrs. Explain generally what's happening while the analysis is running
  * 2hrs. Create bioregions for specific parameters (Howard suggestion).  Someone else could do. (Mike)
  * 4 hrs. Add bioregion map for the globe as a data layer (verify usefulness with Howard).  Will try as vector.

# Will not be completed #

  * Create folder of bioregion scenarios that expose the problems/rough edges? (Astrid suggestion)
  * 4 days+ Changing the projection to Goods. Requires significant software update under the hood to support it and reprojecting the input data layers.
  * can you make it easier to add say a description later while viewing?  instead of providing from the start or going into edit mode (requires core marinemap changes)
